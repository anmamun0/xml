📌 Learning XML XPath
XPath (XML Path Language) is a powerful query language for selecting nodes from an XML document. It allows you to navigate through the XML document structure and extract data based on various conditions.


## 🔹 1️⃣ What is XPath?
#### XPath is used to navigate through elements and attributes in an XML document. It provides a way to query specific parts of an XML structure using paths.

##### XPath Expressions are used to select nodes in an XML document.
##### XPath supports absolute and relative paths to find nodes.



#### 🔹 2️⃣ Basic XPath Syntax
- Root node: /
- Child node: /
- Descendant node: //
- Attribute node: @
- Text node: text()


#### XPath Syntax	Description 
| symble |                                   |
|--------|-----------------------------------|
| /      | Root element                         |
| //     | Selects nodes anywhere in the document |
| @      | Selects attributes |
| *      | Wildcard (selects all elements) |
| []     | Predicate (filters nodes) |
| text() | Selects text inside an element  |


##### xml file
```xml
<library>
    <book id="1">
        <title>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</title>
        <author>Douglas Adams</author>
    </book>
    <book id="2">
        <title>1984</title>
        <author>George Orwell</author>
    </book>
</library>

```


## 🔹 4️⃣ Basic XPath Queries

```
- 1 Selecting the Root Node: ──────────────────├──  /library
- 2 Selecting All Book Elements:───────────────├──  /library/book
- 3 Selecting the Title of the First Book:─────├──  /library/book[1]/title
- 4 Selecting the Author of the Second Book:───├──  /library/book[2]/author
- 5 Selecting All Titles:──────────────────────├──  //title
- 6 Selecting Books with Specific Attribute:───├──  /library/book[@id='1']
- 7 Selecting Text Inside a Title:─────────────├──  /library/book/title/text()
```




## 🔹 5️⃣ XPath Operators

```html
1.  Equality (=): Used to match a specific value. 
├──/library/book[@id='1']

Selects the <book> element with id="1".


2. Comparison (<, >, <=, >=): You can compare values.
├──/library/book[price>30]

Selects the <book> element where the price is greater than 30.


3. and & or: Combine multiple conditions.
├──/library/book[@id='1' and author='Douglas Adams']

Selects the <book> element with id="1" and an author of "Douglas Adams".


4. * (wildcard): Selects all elements regardless of their name.
├──/library/*

Selects all child elements of <library>.
 
```



## 🔹 6️⃣ Using XPath with JavaScript

You can use XPath in JavaScript to query an XML document.

Here’s how you can use XPath in JavaScript:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>XPath Example in JavaScript</h2>
<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
var xmlText = `
<library>
    <book id="1">
        <title>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</title>
        <author>Douglas Adams</author>
    </book>
    <book id="2">
        <title>1984</title>
        <author>George Orwell</author>
    </book>
</library>
`;

var parser = new DOMParser();
var xmlDoc = parser.parseFromString(xmlText, "text/xml");

// Use XPath to select all titles
var titles = xmlDoc.evaluate("//title", xmlDoc, null, XPathResult.ANY_TYPE, null);
var result = titles.iterateNext();
var titleText = "";
while (result) {
    titleText += result.textContent + "<br>";
    result = titles.iterateNext();
}

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = titleText;
</script>

</body>
</html>

```
#### Output:
```
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
1984
```

 
#### In this example:
- `evaluate()` runs an XPath query on the xmlDoc.
- `iterateNext()` is used to loop through the matching nodes. 


   
## 🔹 7️⃣ XPath Functions

- 1 contains(): Checks if a string contains a substring.
 
```xml
//book[contains(title, 'Hitchhiker')]
```

###### Selects the <book> where the title contains "Hitchhiker".

- 2 starts-with(): Checks if a string starts with a specific substring.

```xml
//book[starts-with(title, 'The')]
```

###### Selects the <book> where the title starts with "The".

- 3 text(): Selects text nodes.
 
```xml
/library/book/title[text()='1984']
```

###### Selects the <book> element where the <title> text is "1984".






🔹 8️⃣ XPath Axis
XPath allows you to move around nodes in the document using axes.

 
- 1 child: Selects the children of the context node.

```
//book/child::title
```
###### Selects the <title> elements that are children of the <book> elements.

- 2 parent: Selects the parent of the context node.

```
//title/parent::book
```

###### Selects the <book> element that is the parent of the <title>.

- 3 ancestor: Selects all ancestors (parents, grandparents, etc.).

```
//title/ancestor::library
```

###### Selects the <library> element that is an ancestor of the <title>.

- 4 descendant: Selects all descendants (children, grandchildren, etc.).

```
/library/descendant::author
```

###### Selects all <author> elements that are descendants of <library>.


<h6> 
🎯 Summary <br>
XPath is a language for querying and navigating XML documents. <br>
You can use it to select, filter, and traverse XML data efficiently. <br>
It works well with JavaScript using the evaluate() function and is widely used in XML-related tasks such as web scraping, XML data processing, and searching. <br><br>
